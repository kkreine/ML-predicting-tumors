# Predicting Malignant or Benign Tumors with Python

In this data set, I apply k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and bagging on the tumor prediction data set. The data set contains information about patient measurements. The output label is either 'M' for malignant tumor or 'B' for benign tumor.
